So recently after finishing up the Inter-IIT Technical Meet 12.0 at IIT Madras (a blog on it soon üòù), our gang headed straight to Pondicherry for some much needed relaxation. This trip was much more easy-going and unplanned than most of my usual trips. We would wake up according to our time, stop and take pictures for as long as we wanted or let the ocean breeze soothe our faces without an eye on the clock. Ah, peace!

## Day 1

We had planned to leave Chennai at 9 AM ~~sharp~~, but thanks to the 10-hour long Inter-IIT Techboard meeting last night, I comfortably slept till 9:30 AM. Then getting fresh hurriedly while the girls waited for us boys, we packed out stuff and bid adieu to the Cauvery hostel which was our home for the past three nights. We headed straight to the Himalaya food court at IITM, since many of us hadn't had a proper meal since more than a day. I am a firm believer in *"pehle pet pooja, phir kaam dooja" (first must you eat, then other things must you complete)* myself, and after gulping down fresh Masala Dosa and Coffee Shake, we boarded our Uber SUV and began the trip to Pondi(cherry)!
